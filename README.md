This is my first Joomla Gallery.
It works on Joomla 2.5 or 3.x
After installation:
You will need to specify the folder name of the pictures that you want to display. If the folder doesnt have any pictures, or were spleed incorrectly, it will display an error message to double check this information.
You will need to specify the thumb size.
For Joomla 3.x, if your template is using the built in bootstrap framework of Joomla you can check this in your template if it has the following line:
JHtml::_('bootstrap.framework');
you will have to accept to add AGAIN jquery and bootstrap.min.js, I know that this is not good but so far I havent found a solution for this problem!

Know issues:
1. General Styling:
	a. Thumbs needs styling
	b. Image inside the modal needs styling.
2. When clicking on an odd thumbnail, the modal window will display first all the odd images and then the even images. The opposite happens when cliked in the even thumbs
3. Contact me through my website http://www.fabianmanzano.info if you find any other issues, or if you find a great solution for the know issues!!

Thanks for using the gallery, remeber to rate it in the JED.
